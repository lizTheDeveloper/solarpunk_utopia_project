## Implementation Notes

These features should be:
- **Community-driven**: Let communities choose what they need
- **Modular**: Not everything needs to be in the core platform
- **Extensible**: Support plugins and community modifications
- **Open source**: Communities can fork and modify
- **Federated**: Share what makes sense, keep local what should be local

The goal is to provide **infrastructure for freedom**, not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different communities will prioritize different features based on their context, values, and needs.

## Questions for Future Development

1. How do we balance feature richness with simplicity and accessibility?
2. Which features should be core vs. optional extensions?
3. How do we ensure the platform evolves with community needs?
4. What governance model should guide platform development itself?
5. How do we prevent scope creep while remaining responsive?

Remember: The best platform is the one that gets out of the way and lets communities thrive. Technology should be liberating, not controlling. Build tools that empower, not systems that dominate.

**Fully automated luxury space communism means abundance for all, joy as a right, and AI handling the boring coordination while humans focus on creation, connection, and celebration.** 🌻✨🚀
